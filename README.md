# 🧱 3D Printing Portfolio

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is a personal collection of my favorite 3D printing projects — fun, functional, and sometimes just a little quirky.

Here you’ll find:
- 🔧 Custom parts and everyday tools
- 🏡 Smart home components
- 🎁 Small gadgets and decorative prints
- 🧵 Sewing accessories and organizers

All models are designed using tools like **Onshape** or **Tinkercad**, and printed on my **Ender 3 S1 Pro**.  

Stay tuned — I’m always working on something new! 😄
